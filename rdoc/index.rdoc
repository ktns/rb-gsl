# == Description
# {Ruby/GSL}[https://blackwinter.github.com/rb-gsl] is a ruby interface to the {GNU Scientific Library}[https://gnu.org/software/gsl/] (GSL), for numerical computing with {Ruby}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/].
#
# == Installation
# === Using the gem command
# Ruby/GSL may now be installed as a Ruby Gem by simply running
#
#   gem install rb-gsl
#
# Note that the GSL libraries must already be installed before Ruby/GSL
# can be installed.
#
# * It is recommended to install the
#   {GNU plotutils}[https://gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html]
#   package.  Some of the example scripts in the 'examples/' directory use the
#   <tt>graph</tt> utility included in the package to plot the results.
#   Windows-cygwin binaries of <tt>GNU plotutils</tt> and related packages are
#   available from {here}[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/plotutils.htm].
#
# == Reference
#
# The {Ruby/GSL reference manual}[link:ref_rdoc.html] follows and borrows
# large parts of the GSL reference manual.
#
# == Examples
# See scripts in <tt>examples/</tt> and <tt>tests/</tt> directories.
