# == {}[link:index.html"name="1] Description
# {Ruby/GSL}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rb-gsl/"target="_top] is a ruby interface to the {GNU Scientific Library}[http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/"target="_top] (GSL), for numerical computing with {Ruby}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"target="_top]. 
#
# == {}[link:index.html"name="3] Installation
# === {}[link:index.html"name="3.1] Using the gem command
# Ruby/GSL may now be installed as a Ruby Gem by simply running
#
#   gem install rb-gsl
#
# Note that the GSL libraries must already be installed before Ruby/GSL
# can be installed.
#
# === {}[link:index.html"name="3.2] Using the setup.rb command
# If you prefer, Ruby/GSL may still be installed using setup.rb.
# 1. Get and install {GSL}[http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/#downloading"target="_top]. Make sure the command "gsl-config" is in command search path.
# 1. {Download}[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=285"target="_top] Ruby/GSL, ungzip and untar the archive <tt>rb-gsl-xxx.tgz</tt>. 
# 1. <tt> % cd rb-gsl-xxx/</tt>
# 1. <tt> % ruby setup.rb config</tt>

#
# * It is recommended to install the
#   {GNU plotutils}[http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html"target="_top]
#   package.  Some of the example scripts in the 'examples/' directory use the
#   <tt>graph</tt> utility included in the package to plot the results.
#   Windows-cygwin binaries of <tt>GNU plotutils</tt> and related packages are
#   available from {here}[http://rustam.uwp.edu/support"target="_top].
